\section{Question 3}



\subsection{part a.}
S = superman is defeated \\
O = facing opponent alone \\
OK = opponent is carrying kryptonite \\

For superman to be defeated, it has to be that he is facing an opponent alone and his opponent is carrying kryptonite. \\
(O \land OK) \to S \\
\neg (O \land OK) \lor S
\neg O \lor \neg OK \lor S \\


AK = acquiring kryptonite \\
BC = batman coordinates with lex luther \\
BA = batman acquires kryptonite from lex \\

Acquiring kryptonite, however, means that batman has to coordinate with lex luther and
acquire it from him. \\

AK \to (BC \land BA) \\
\neg AK \lor (BC \land BA) \\
\neg AK \lor \neg BC \lor \neg BA \\

WU = wonder woman is upset \\
WS = wonder woman fights with superman \\

If, however, batman coordinates with lex luther, this upsets wonder woman who will intervene and fight on the side of superman\\
BC \to WU \land WS
\neg BC \lor WU \lor WS

\subsection{part b.}
Turning the above statements into 3-cnf form

(\neg O \lor \neg OK \lor S) \land (\neg AK \lor \neg BC \lor \neg BA) \land (\neg BC \lor WU \lor WS)

\subsection{part c.}
NOT DONE
