\section{Question 2}

\subsection{part a.}
The set of variables is the combination of the row and column of the grid. \\
X = {[1,1], [1,2], ... , [i,j-1], [i, j]}

The domain is the possible values that each variable can hold: 1 to 9.\\
D = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The constraint is that each row, column, and neighboring box must hold unique values in each of the variables.

i, j = fixed variable
I, J = random variable
C = {(X(1,1), X(1,2), X(1,3), X(1,4), X(1,5), X(1,6), X(1,7), X(1,8), X(1,9)), X(1,1) != X(1,2) != X(1,3) != X(1,4) != X(1,5) != X(1,6) != X(1,7) != X(1,8) != X(1,9)}
